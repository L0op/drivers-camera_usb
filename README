Driver for UVC compatible webcams.
Also tested with the Gumstix camera e-CAM32 OMAP GSTIX.
This driver uses 4vl2 for direct configurations and GStreamer 
for image-requesting and jpeg-conversion. 

Formerly this driver used a precompiled GStreamer packet (see
http://felipec.wordpress.com/tag/gstreamer/ for details).
Currently the system libraries are used (tested for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS i686 and
Debian 6.0.2 armv7l) and (on the Gumstix) the cross-compiled gst-dsp copied to
/usr/lib/gstreamer-0.10. The driver uses non-accelerated jpeg-conversion if
gst-dsp is not available.

NOTE
This directory structure follows some simple rules, to allow for generic build
processes and simplify reuse of this project. 

For build automation the project structure should be parsed and validated


STRUCTURE
-- src/ 
	Contains all header (*.h/*.hpp) and source files
-- build/
	The target directory for the build process, temporary content
-- bindings/
	Language bindings for this package, e.g. put into subfolders such as
   |-- ruby/ 
        Ruby language bindings
-- viz/
        Source files for a vizkit plugin / widget related to this library 
-- resources/
	General resources such as images that are needed by the program
-- configuration/
	Configuration files for running the program
-- external/
	When including software that needs a non standard installation process, or one that can be
	easily embedded include the external software directly here
-- doc/
	should contain the existing doxygen file: doxygen.conf
