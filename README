This usb camera driver uses 4vl2 to configure the connected usb camera and GStreamer 
to request images and to convert them to jpegs. 

Depends on the gst_dsp_arm packet. This is more or less just a link to the
precompiled GStreamer-packet located in /opt/arm/gst.
In the gst_dsp_arm packet you can find a ruby script which can be used to
(cross-)compile and install GStreamer and its dependencies (for your system as well as for 
ARM-architecture).
Thus, you can use this driver on the Gumstix to request images from the
e-CAM32_OMAP_GSTIX, as well. In addition, the dsp - if available - will be
used for jpeg-compression.

NOTE
This directory structure follows some simple rules, to allow for generic build
processes and simplify reuse of this project. 

For build automation the project structure should be parsed and validated


STRUCTURE
-- src/ 
	Contains all header (*.h/*.hpp) and source files
-- build/
	The target directory for the build process, temporary content
-- bindings/
	Language bindings for this package, e.g. put into subfolders such as
   |-- ruby/ 
        Ruby language bindings
-- viz/
        Source files for a vizkit plugin / widget related to this library 
-- resources/
	General resources such as images that are needed by the program
-- configuration/
	Configuration files for running the program
-- external/
	When including software that needs a non standard installation process, or one that can be
	easily embedded include the external software directly here
-- doc/
	should contain the existing doxygen file: doxygen.conf
